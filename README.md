# RoleFilter

Click on a role inside a user's popout menu to filter the online user's list to user's with that role.

### Installation
1. Download [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/)
2. Download the plugin file `releases/RoleFilter.plugin.js`
3. Place the plugin file in your plugins folder (See BD's [FAQ](https://betterdiscord.app/FAQ))

### TODO
- Display filter on the users list
- Improve appearance of filter display (role color, pill shape, total users?)
- **[X]** button to remove the filter (keyboard shortcut too?)
- Filtering on multiple roles
- Switch between AND/OR for multiple roles
- Right click to filter a role out (instead of in, which is default behavior)
